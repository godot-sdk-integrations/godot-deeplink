# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godot-sdk-integrations/godot-deeplink/main/addon/icon.png" width="24"> Godot Deeplink Plugin

Deeplink plugin provides a unified GDScript interface for processing of App Links on the Android platform and Universal Links on the iOS platform in order to enable direct navigation to specific app content.

**Features:**
- Enable web links to directly access app content.
- Provide support for custom schemes.
- Check if a domain is associated with app.
- Forward users to related app settings on platform.

<a name="usage"></a>

## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godot-sdk-integrations/godot-deeplink/main/addon/icon.png" width="20"> Usage
- Add `Deeplink` nodes to your scene per URL association and follow the following steps:
	- set the required field on each `Deeplink` node
		- `scheme` - schemes like `http`, `https`, or a custom scheme (don't include `://`)
		- `host` - domain name
		- `path prefix` - optional path before link is considered a deeplink
	- note that `scheme`, `host`, and `path prefix` must all match for a URI to be processed by the app
		- leave `path prefix` empty to process all paths in `host`
- register a listener for the `deeplink_received` signal
	- process `url`, `scheme`, `host`, and `path` data from the signal
- invoke the `initialize()` method at startup
  - `initialize()` plugin and connect its signals as early as possible (ie. in `_ready()` lifecycle method of your main node)
- alternatively, use the following methods to get most recent deeplink data:
	- `get_link_url()` -> full URL for the deeplink
	- `get_link_scheme()` -> scheme for the deeplink (ie. 'https')
	- `get_link_host()` -> host for the deeplink (ie. 'www.example.com')
	- `get_link_path()` -> path for the deeplink (the part that comes after host)
- additional methods:
	- `is_domain_associated(a_domain: String)` -> returns true if your application is correctly associated with the given domain on the tested device
    	- _note: `is_domain_associated()` method does not support custom schemes_
	- `navigate_to_open_by_default_settings()` -> navigates to the Android OS' `Open by Default` settings screen for your application

**Usage Example**:

```
extends Node

@onready var deeplink: Deeplink = $Deeplink


func _ready() -> void:
	# Initialize the plugin as early as possible
	deeplink.initialize()

	# Connect the signal (can also be done in the editor)
	deeplink.deeplink_received.connect(_on_deeplink_received)


func _on_deeplink_received(url: DeeplinkUrl) -> void:
	print("Full URL: ", url.get_url())
	print("Scheme: ", url.get_scheme())
	print("Host: ", url.get_host())
	print("Path: ", url.get_path())
	print("Query: ", url.get_query())
```

**Notes**:

- `initialize()` should be called in the main scene’s `_ready()` method.
- The `deeplink_received` signal is emitted only when the URL matches the configured `scheme`, `host`, and optional `path_prefix`.
- Deeplink data is also accessible via `get_link_*()` methods on the Deeplink node.

<a name="signals"></a>

## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godot-sdk-integrations/godot-deeplink/main/addon/icon.png" width="20"> Signals

- `deeplink_received(url: DeeplinkUrl)`: Emitted when app content is requested via deeplink. Must be connected at startup, as early as possible, or via Godot Editor.

---

<a name="methods"></a>

## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godot-sdk-integrations/godot-deeplink/main/addon/icon.png" width="20"> Methods

- `initialize() -> int`
Initializes the native plugin and connects platform-specific listeners.
Must be called as early as possible, ideally in _ready() of the main scene.

- `navigate_to_open_by_default_settings() -> void`
Opens the Android Open by Default settings screen for the application.
Android only.

- `get_link_url() -> String`
Returns the full deeplink URL as a string.

- `get_link_scheme() -> String`
Returns the scheme of the last received deeplink (e.g. https, myapp).

- `get_link_host() -> String`
Returns the host/domain of the last received deeplink.

- `get_link_path() -> String`
Returns the path portion of the last received deeplink.

- `clear_data() -> void`
Clears stored deeplink data inside the plugin.

### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godot-sdk-integrations/godot-deeplink/main/addon/icon.png" width="16"> Android-only Methods

- `is_domain_associated(a_domain: String) -> bool`
Returns true if the given domain is correctly associated with the app on the current device.
Android only. Custom schemes are not supported.

Plugin classes.

### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godot-sdk-integrations/godot-deeplink/main/addon/icon.png" width="16"> Deeplink

Main node used to declare and configure deeplink associations for your application.

**Responsibilities**:

- Defines which `scheme`, `host`, and optional `path_prefix` should be handled
- Exports deeplink configuration for Android App Links and iOS Universal Links
- Connects to the native plugin singleton
- Emits the `deeplink_received` signal when a matching deeplink is opened

**Typical usage**:

- Add one or more Deeplink nodes to your scene
- Configure their exported properties
- Call `initialize()` at startup
- Listen to `deeplink_received` signal

### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godot-sdk-integrations/godot-deeplink/main/addon/icon.png" width="16"> DeeplinkUrl

Lightweight wrapper class representing a parsed deeplink URL.

This class is constructed from native platform data and provides structured access to URL components such as:

- `scheme`
- `user`
- `password`
- `host`
- `port`
- `path`
- `path_components`
- `query`
- `fragment`

It is emitted as the argument of the deeplink_received signal and can also reconstruct the full URL string.

**Sample usage**:

```
func _on_deeplink_received(url: DeeplinkUrl) -> void:
	print(url.get_url())
	print(url.get_host())
	print(url.get_path())
```

<a name="export"></a>

## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godot-sdk-integrations/godot-deeplink/main/addon/icon.png" width="20"> Export

Three options:

- Add `Deeplink` node to main scene
- Open scene with `Deeplink` nodes in the editor before export
- Use file-based export

1. **File-based Export Configuration**
In order to enable file-based export configuration, an `export.cfg` file should be placed in the `addons/DeeplinkPlugin` directory. The `export.cfg` configuration file may contain multiple deeplink configurations. The `scheme` and `host` properties are mandatory for each deeplink configuration.

The following is a sample `export.cfg` file:

```
[Deeplink1]
scheme = "https"
host = "www.example.com"

[Deeplink2]
scheme = "https"
host = "www.example2.com"
```

Example `export.cfg` file with Android-specific properties:

```
[Deeplink3]
label = "deeplink1"
is_auto_verify = true
is_default = true
is_browsable = true
scheme = "https"
host = "www.example.com"
path_prefix = "/my_data"
```

2. **Node-based Export Configuration**
If `export.cfg` file is not found or file-based configuration is invalid, then the plugin will attempt to load node-based configuration.

During iOS export, the plugin searches for `Deeplink` nodes in the scene that is open in the Godot Editor. If none found, then the plugin searches for `Deeplink` nodes in the project's main scene. Therefore; 
- Make sure that the scene that contains the `Deeplink` node(s) is selected in the Godot Editor when building and exporting for Android, or
- Make sure that your Godot project's main scene contains one or more `Deeplink` nodes.

## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godot-sdk-integrations/godot-deeplink/main/addon/icon.png" width="20"> Platform-Specific Notes

In addition to adding and enabling the plugin, **platform-level configuration** is also required before deeplinks can work.

### Android
- **Build:** [Create custom Android gradle build](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/android_gradle_build.html).
- **Domain Association:** [Associate Godot app with a domain](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/app-link-indexing#associatesite).
- **Custom schemes:** Chrome has issues opening custom schemes; Firefox is able to open them successfully.
- **Testing:**
  1. Use `adb shell` as follows:
	- `$> adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -c android.intent.category.BROWSABLE -d "https://www.example.com/mydata/path"`
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - Logs: `adb logcat | grep 'godot'` (Linux), `adb.exe logcat | select-string "godot"` (Windows)

### iOS
- **Domain Association:** [Associate Godot app with a domain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-associated-domains).
- **Troubleshooting:**
	- View XCode logs while running the game for troubleshooting.
	- See [Godot iOS Export Troubleshooting](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_ios.html#troubleshooting).
